# ConsoleYak

Custom codeproject for Harvest (all names and characters are fictional)

* Userstory 1 => Set startupproject to ConsoleYak.csproj and provide the input.xml and age
* Userstory 2 => Set startupproject to YakHerdAPI and call API's
* Userstory 3 => As userstory 2 
* Userstory 4 => As userstory 2 and 3 but through Swagger UI
* Userstory 5 => This awesome github project, so the most famous yakherder from Tibet ("Dim Ko Iggl") can post issues, collaborate and get the latest development version.

## Bugfixes 
Unfortunately, after the first order, some male yaks were harmed due to an error. API now checks for that.
